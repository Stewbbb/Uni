Propositional logic is a symbolic logic to reason about logical statements called propositions that can be true or false

propositions are built by combining atomic propositions using logic connectives

an argument is a list of propositions, last is called conclusion and the others are premises 

Symbolic approach

Advantages: non-ambiguous unlike natural language and concise 

atomic propositions connected by logical connectives

propositions that cannot be broken down are atomic e.g. p,q,r

T is true, ⊥ is false

^ And
V or
--> implies
¬ negation

¬A == A-->⊥


Conjunction P AND Q
Disjunction: P OR Q (inclusive OR)
Implication: P --> Q: P is antecedent, Q is consequent
Negation ¬P 

Avoid ambiguity using associativity or precedence

Associativity: 2 x same symbol, decide if brackets left or right, for now all are right associative

precedence: decide which symbols go first (like bidmas) ¬, and, or. -->

**P --> (Q --> R)**
