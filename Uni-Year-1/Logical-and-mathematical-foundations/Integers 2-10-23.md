stupid ass questions: why is it called mod, is -314 congruent to 314, prejump -431 is -5, confidence in 11111111 = -2 



modular arithmetic:
a = b [m]

if b is the same, then a is always congruent
let m = 100

a = 314, b = 14
a = -86, b = 14
314 = -86
therefore 314 and -86 are congruent

multiplication
2 x n = 1[5]

2 x n = 1 + (kx5)
n=3

purpose of modular arithmetic is to stick to integers 


used in computer science in storing integers, overflow

to get negatives go signed representation, still number circle but:

0, 1, 2 ...... 2^31 -1, -2^31 ................ -2, -1, 0

twos compliment always
most significant bit is always 0 for positive and always 1 for negative
