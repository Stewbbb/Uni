Logic is about formalising knowledge in a precise, unambiguous, rigorous way

Propositional logic:
- syntax
- proofs
- semantics, truth tables
- satisfiability
First order logic (predicate calculus)
- syntax
- proofs
- semantics

**Learning outcomes**
- understand and apply algorithms for key problems
- write formal proofs
- apply mathematical and logical techniques to solve a problem


**Propositional logic**

A proposition is a sentence which states a fact: a statement that can be true or false
argument is list of propositions:
last is called conclusion
rest are called premises
E.g.
Premise 1: if there is smoke there is fire
Premise 2: there is no fire
Conclusion: there is no smoke

The argument is valid if and only if the premises are true then so is the conclusion
In examples: premises are assumed to be true

By default in logic or is inclusive (or not xor)
